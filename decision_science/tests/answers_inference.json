    "P_VALUE": "\nThe p-value shows how confident we can be that the median age is important for the number of incidents. The closer to 0 the more confident.\nThere is a 12.8% probability that the median_age is not correlated to the number of incidents. Its effect is statistically significant as 95% and 90%\n",

    "LIMITATIONS": "\nThe main limitation is that we have a very small sample size: Only the 12 districts of Boston. As a result we do not have enough information so that the model can generalise \n\nOther reasons may include:\n* High-correlation\n* Multicollinearity\n* Combined too many parameters\n* Combined together districts that may not be related\n\nTo improve results it could help to\n* Examine districts one-by-one\n* Examine incidents withou grouping by district but by indicators\n"
